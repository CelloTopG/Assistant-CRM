WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The Workers’ Compensation Fund Control Board (WCFCB) recognizes the 
critical importance of a robust Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM) system. As part of the ERPNext implementation, this document 
outlines the Functional Scope Document (FSD) for the CRM Module, 
detailing the customization requirements necessary to align the CRM 
functionalities with the specific operational needs of the Board. 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
2. SCOPE 
This document covers the additional functionalities that must be 
incorporated into the ERPNext CRM Module to fully meet WCFCB’s 
needs. It builds upon ERPNext’s base capabilities and ensures a more 
integrated, centralized, and intelligent customer management system.  
Key areas include: 
− Integration with existing contact center systems (Tawk.to, others). 
− Centralized communication via social media and messaging 
platforms. 
− Deployment of customizable surveys and intelligent reporting. 
− Full integration with the CoreBusiness system for unified data 
analytics. 
− Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for predictive analytics, 
automation, and smart reports. 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
3.1 TAWK.TO AND CONTACT CENTER INTEGRATION 
To enhance centralized customer interaction management, the CRM 
Module must seamlessly integrate with Tawk.to and the Board’s existing 
Contact Center system. This integration will ensure that all 
communication touchpoints — calls, chats, emails, and social media 
interactions — are accessible and manageable from a single, unified 
platform, greatly improving efficiency, response times, and customer 
satisfaction. 
The integration must be bi-directional, allowing real-time data exchange 
between ERPNext CRM and the Contact Center, ensuring consistency 
across systems. 
Requirements include: 
− Integration with all major social media platforms for centralized 
communications. 
− Third-party bulk messaging integration allowing selection of 
messaging channels. 
− Full call center integration for real-time call management. 
3.1.1 INTEGRATION WITH ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS 
To ensure centralized management of customer communications, the 
CRM must fully aggregate and unify messages from all major social 
media platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, 
Twitter (X), Telegram, and LinkedIn. 
The goal is to allow customer service agents and other Board users to 
handle all client interactions through a single interface, without the need 
to log into multiple external platforms. 
Centralized Communication Hub 
Messages from all integrated platforms must appear in a single inbox 
view, linked to the customer’s CRM profile for full interaction history and 
context. 
One-Click Multi-Platform Broadcasting 
When creating an announcement, blog post, or update, users should be 
able to select multiple platforms and broadcast the content with a single 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
click. This ensures consistent messaging across all customer channels 
while saving significant time and effort. 
Generative AI Integration for Content Composure 
CRM should integrate with AI writing services (e.g., OpenAI, Google 
Gemini, or similar models) to assist users in composing professional, 
clear, and structured messages. 
This would allow: 
− Grammar and tone checks. 
− Auto-suggested posts based on the announcement topic. 
− Rewriting or summarization tools to tailor messages per platform 
(e.g., a shorter version for X, a formal one for LinkedIn etc.) 
AI-Based Auto-Responses 
Incoming queries on social media should be answered automatically 
using intelligent AI Bots trained specifically on the Board's processes, 
services, FAQs, and common inquiries. 
The system should: 
− Recognize common customer questions and answer them 
instantly. 
− Escalate complex queries to human agents when necessary. 
− Continuously learn from previous interactions to improve future 
responses. 
3.1.2 CRM BOARD'S VIRTUAL ASSISTANT – FAQ HANDLING 
To enhance customer self-service and reduce manual workload, a CRM 
Board Virtual Assistant (Bot) must be deployed across all integrated 
platforms. 
Features of the CRM Board Bot: 
Automated FAQs Management 
The Bot must be trained with a detailed FAQ database covering key 
topics such as beneficiary services, employer assessments, claims 
procedures, contribution processes, and Board contacts. 
Multilingual Support 
Where necessary, the Bot should support Zambia’s key languages 
besides English, like Bemba, Nyanja, and Tonga, ensuring inclusivity. 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
Escalation Protocols 
For inquiries beyond the Bot’s capability (e.g., complex case-specific 
questions), the Bot must automatically escalate the ticket to a live agent 
while transferring conversation context. 
Personalized Interactions 
When identifying returning customers, the Bot should greet them by 
name, reference previous tickets, and personalize the conversation for a 
better customer experience. 
AI Learning and Updates 
The FAQ database must be updated regularly, and the Bot should use 
machine learning to recognize and adapt to new types of questions 
emerging over time. 
Examples of Bot FAQ Topics 
Category Example Question Example Bot Response 
Contributions "How do I register as 
an employer?" 
"You can register via our 
online portal or visit any 
WCFCB office. [More Details]" 
Claims "How do I file a 
compensation claim or 
report an accident?" 
"Please submit Form6 via our 
Claims Section or through our 
online platform." 
Assessments "When is my next 
assessment due?" 
"Assessments are due 
annually. You will receive a 
reminder. [View your account 
here]" 
Payments "How can I pay my 
contributions?" 
"Payments can be made via 
bank transfer, mobile money, 
or direct deposit via any of our 
branch bank accounts."

3.1.3 THIRD-PARTY BULK MESSAGING INTEGRATION 
The CRM system must provide seamless integration with third-party 
messaging services to allow bulk communication across multiple 
platforms through a single, user-friendly interface. The following are the 
functional requirements. 
Multi-Channel Broadcasting 
Users must be able to compose a single message and select multiple or 
all available channels (e.g., SMS, WhatsApp, Email, Slack, Telegram, 
Facebook Messenger) via an intuitive multi-select dropdown. 
Recipient Categorization 
The system must allow users to categorize and target specific groups 
such as: 
− Employers 
− Beneficiaries 
− Suppliers 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
− Internal Staff 
Dynamic Targeting 
Recipients should be selectable based on: 
− Pre-defined groups (e.g., "All Employers", "Active Beneficiaries", 
"Registered Suppliers") 
− Filters (e.g., based on region, industry, type of pension, return 
history, payment status, branch etc.) 
Scheduling and Immediate Dispatch 
Ability to either schedule messages for future delivery or send 
immediately. 
Template Management 
Pre-approved templates for common alerts must be available, 
customizable before sending. 
Use Cases / Examples 
Employers 
− Reminders for submission of annual returns.  
− Notifications on upcoming assessment payments. 
Beneficiaries 
− Reminders to submit Life Certificates,  
− updates on pension increments or benefits changes. 
Suppliers 
− Notifications about procurement opportunities, clarifications on 
tender submissions, payment follow-ups. 
Internal Communication 
• Policy updates, internal announcements, critical alerts for staff. 
Advanced AI Usage 
• Personalization at Scale 
AI should enable dynamic personalization — inserting variables 
like Name, Employer Number, Pensioner ID into the messaging 
automatically. 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
• Optimal Channel Prediction 
Using historical data, AI could suggest the most effective channel 
per recipient (e.g., SMS for older pensioners, Email for suppliers). 
• Smart Content Recommendations 
CRM should offer smart suggestions on message tone and 
structure based on the recipient category selected (Formal for 
suppliers, Friendly for beneficiaries).

3.1.4 OMNICHANNEL INTERACTION VIEW 
Each customer’s communication history across all channels must be 
visible in one timeline, enabling agents to have full context of previous 
interactions regardless of the platform used. 
3.1.5 AGENT PERFORMANCE TRACKING 
Integration must allow for tracking and reporting on agent productivity 
(e.g., average handling time, resolution rates, customer satisfaction 
scores). 
3.2 CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND SURVEYS 
The CRM must facilitate the creation, distribution, and reporting of 
surveys for employers and beneficiaries. 
An effective CRM must offer robust capabilities to collect, analyze, and 
act upon feedback from both employers and beneficiaries. This ensures 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS 
that the Board continuously improves service delivery based on real, 
actionable insights from its key stakeholders. 
Requirements include: 
− Customizable surveys launched at any time. 
− Automated alerts to survey owners and participants. 
− Dynamic and visually appealing reporting post-survey.

• Downloadable detailed reports (Excel, PDF) 
• Insights with AI-based analysis, such as sentiment analysis on 
free-text feedback 
3.3 COREBUSINESS SYSTEM INTEGRATION 
CRM must integrate seamlessly with the existing CoreBusiness system to 
ensure a unified, real-time, and centralized view of all critical stakeholder 
information. 
This integration is essential for streamlining Board operations, improving 
data accuracy, and enabling advanced reporting and forecasting. 
3.3.1 CENTRALIZED EMPLOYER AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES 
The CRM must pull and synchronize key data from CoreBusiness such 
as: 
− Employer registration details 
− Assessment history 
− Beneficiary payment history 
− Life certificate status 
− Employer returns submissions 
Profiles must be accessible in real-time from the CRM dashboard, with 
changes updated automatically across systems.

Ensure that a comprehensive, 360° profile is available for each 
stakeholder without toggling between systems. 
WORKCOM CONNECT – CRM REQUIREMENTS

Periodic reports (e.g., monthly, quarterly) should be automatically 
generated by the system. 
Reports must include: 
− Key metrics (e.g., assessment collections, beneficiary trends 
− Recommendations generated by AI (e.g., "Focus on Region X for 
improvement in returns collection") 
− Highlight anomalies or urgent issues automatically. 
Users must also be able to request on-demand reports with custom date 
ranges and filters.
